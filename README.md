# Wishbnb

Winner of Best iOS Hack at WHACK 2017

A an app & website aimed at bringing joy to the lives of terminally ill children. Wishers can fill a pinboard with all the things they love about life. We then use an AI to match their interests to a dream vacation. After we find an Airbnb for them the child's parent's can crowdfund the trip through Wishbnb.
